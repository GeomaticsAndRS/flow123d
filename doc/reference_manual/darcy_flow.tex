\section{Darcy Flow Model} \label{sec:darcy_flow}
We consider the simplest model for the velocity of the steady or unsteady flow in porous and fractured medium given by 
the Darcy flow:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:darcy}
    \vc w = -\tn K \grad H \quad\text{on }\Omega_d,\ \text{for $d=1,2,3$}.
\end{equation}
We drop the dimension index of quantities in equations if it is the same as the dimension of the set where the equation holds.
In \eqref{eq:darcy}, $\vc w_d$ \units{}{1}{-1} is \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superficial_velocity}{the superficial velocity},
$\tn K_d$ is the conductivity tensor, and $H_d$ \units{}{1}{} is the piezometric head. The velocity is related to the flux $\vc q_d$ 
\units{}{4-d}{-1} through
\[
    \vc q_d = \delta_d \vc w_d,
\]
where 
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::cross-section}{$\delta_d$} 
\units{}{3-d}{} is a cross section coefficient, in particular $\delta_3=1$, $\delta_2$ \units{}{1}{} is the thickness of a fracture, and $\delta_1$ \units{}{2}{} is the cross-section of a channel.
The flux $\vc q_d\cdot\vc n$ is the volume of the liquid (water) that passes through a unit square ($d=3$),
unit line ($d=2$), or through a point ($d=1$) per one second. 
The conductivity tensor is given by the product \penalty-500
$\tn K_d = k_d \tn A_d$, where 
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::conductivity}{$k_d>0$} is the hydraulic conductivity \units{}{1}{-1} and 
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::anisotropy}{$\tn A_d$} is 
$3\times 3$ dimensionless anisotropy tensor which has to be symmetric and positive definite. The piezometric-head $H_d$ is related to the pressure head
$h_d$ by $H_d = h_d + z$ assuming that the gravity force acts in the negative direction of the $z$-axis. 
Combining these relations we get the Darcy law in the form:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:darcy_flux}
    \vc q = -\delta k\tn A \grad (h+z)  \qquad\text{in }\Omega_d,\ \text{for $d=1,2,3$}.
\end{equation}

Next, we employ the continuity equation for saturated porous medium and the dimensional reduction from the preceding section (with $w=u:=H$, $\vc j:=\vc w$, $\tn A:=\tn K$ and $\vc b:=\vc 0$), which yields:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:continuity}
    \prtl_t (\delta S\, h) + \div \vc q = F \qquad \text{in }\Omega_d,\ \text{for $d=1,2,3$},
\end{equation}
where \hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::storativity}{$S_d$} \units{}{-1}{} is the storativity and $F_d$ \units{}{3-d}{-1} is a source term. In our setting the principal unknowns of the system 
(\ref{eq:darcy_flux}, \ref{eq:continuity}) are the pressure head $h_d$ and the flux $\vc q_d$.


The storativity (or the volumetric specific storage) $S_d>0$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  S_d = \gamma_w(\beta_r + \vartheta \beta_w),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_w$ \units{1}{-2}{-2} is the specific weight of water, $\vartheta$ \units{}{}{} is the porosity, $\beta_r$ is compressibility of the bulk material of the pores (rock)
and $\beta_w$ is compressibility of the water, both with units \units{-1}{1}{-2}. For steady problems we set $S_d=0$ for all dimensions $d=1,2,3$.
The source term $F_d$ on the right hand side of \eqref{eq:continuity} consists of the volume density of prescribed sources 
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::water-source-density}{$f_d$} \units{}{}{-1} and flux from higher dimension. 
Exact formula is slightly different for every dimension and will be discussed presently.

In $\Omega_3$ we simply have $F_3  = f_3$ \units{}{}{-1}.

In the set $\Omega_2 \cap \Omega_3$ the fracture is surrounded by one 3D surface from every side (or just one surface since we allow also 2D models on the boundary).
On $\prtl\Omega_3 \cap \Omega_2$ we prescribe a boundary condition of Robin type:
\begin{align*}
        \vc{q}_3\cdot \vc n^{+} &= q_{32}^{+} =\sigma_{3} (h_3^{+}-h_2),\\
        \vc{q}_3\cdot \vc n^{-} &= q_{32}^{-} =\sigma_{3} (h_3^{-}-h_2),
\end{align*}
where $\vc{q}_3\cdot\vc n^{+/-}$ \units{}{1}{-1} is the outflow from $\Omega_3$, $h_3^{+/-}$ is
a trace of the pressure head in $\Omega_3$, $h_2$ is the pressure head in $\Omega_2$, and 
$\sigma_{3}$ \units{}{}{-1} is the transition coefficient given by (see section \ref{sc:ad_on_fractures} and \cite{martin_modeling_2005})
\[
\label{e:sigma3_law}
  \sigma_3 = \sigma_{32} \frac{2\tn K_2 :\vc n_2\otimes\vc n_2 }{\delta_2}.
\]
Here $\vc n_2$ is the unit normal to the fracture (sign doesn't matter).
On the other hand, the sum of the interchange fluxes $q_{32}^{+/-}$ forms
a volume source in $\Omega_2$.  Therefore $F_2$ \units{}{1}{-1} on the right hand side of \eqref{eq:continuity} is
given by
\begin{equation}
   \label{source_2D}
   F_2 = \delta_2 f_2 + (q_{32}^{+} + q_{32}^{-}).
\end{equation}

The communication between $\Omega_2$  and  $\Omega_1$ is similar.  However, in the 3D ambient space,
a 1D channel can join multiple 2D fractures $1,\dots, n$. Therefore, we have $n$
independent outflows from $\Omega_2$:
\begin{equation*}
        \vc{q}_2\cdot \vc n^{i} = q_{21}^{i} =\sigma_{2} (h_2^{i}-h_1),
\end{equation*}
where $\sigma_2$ \units{}{1}{-1} is the transition coefficient integrated over the width of the fracture $i$:
\[
\label{e:sigma2_law}
  \sigma_2 = \sigma_{21} \frac{2\delta_2^2\tn K_1:{\vc n_1^i}\otimes{\vc n_1^i}}{\delta_1}.
\]
Here $\vc n_1^i$ is the unit normal to the channel that is tangential to the fracture $i$.
Sum of the fluxes forms a part of $F_1$ \units{}{2}{-1}:
\begin{equation}
   \label{source_1D}
   F_1 = \delta_1 f_1 + \sum_{i=1}^n q_{21}^{i}. 
\end{equation}
We remark that the direct communication between 3D and 1D is neglected.
The transition coefficients 
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::sigma}{$\sigma_{32}$} \units{}{}{} and
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::sigma}{$\sigma_{21}$} \units{}{}{} are independent scaling parameters which represent the ratio of the crosswind and the tangential conductivity in the fracture.

In order to obtain unique solution we have to prescribe boundary conditions. Currently we support three basic 
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::bc-type}{types of boundary conditions}. 
Consider a disjoint decomposition of the boundary
\[
    \prtl\Omega_d = \Gamma_d^D \cap \Gamma_d^N \cap \Gamma_d^R
\]
into Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin parts. We prescribe
\begin{align}
    h_d &= h_d^D        &&\text{ on }\Gamma_d^D,\\
    \vc q_d \cdot \vc n &= q_d^N         &&\text{ on }\Gamma_d^N,\\
    \vc q_d \cdot \vc n &= \sigma_d^R ( h_d - h_d^R)     &&\text{ on }\Gamma_d^R.
\end{align}
where 
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::bc-pressure}{$h_d^D$, $h_d^R$} 
is the given pressure head \units{}{1}{}, which alternatively can be prescribed through the piezometric head 
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::bc-piezo-head}{$H_d^D$, $H_d^R$} 
respectively. 
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::bc-flux}{$q_d^N$} 
is the given surface density of the boundary outflow \units{}{4-d}{-1}, and  
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::bc-robin-sigma}{$\sigma_d^R$} 
is the transition coefficient \units{}{3-d}{-1}.
The problem is well posed only if there is Dirichlet or Robin boundary condition on every component of the set $\Omega_1 \cup \Omega_2 \cup \Omega_3$ and $\sigma_d >0$ for 
$d=2,3$.

For unsteady problems one has to specify an initial condition in terms of initial pressure head 
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::init-pressure}{$h_d^0$} 
or initial piezometric head 
\hyperA{DarcyFlowMH-Data::init-piezo-head}{$H_d^0$}.

\paragraph{Volume balance.}
The equation \eqref{eq:continuity} satisfies the volume balance of the liquid in the following form:
\[ V(0) + \int_0^t s(\tau) \,d\tau - \int_0^t f(\tau) \,d\tau = V(t) \]
for any instant $t$ in the computational time interval.
Here
$$ V(t) := \sum_{d=1}^3\int_{\Omega^d}(\delta S h)(t,\vc x)\,d\vc x, $$
$$ s(t) := \sum_{d=1}^3\int_{\Omega^d}F(t,\vc x)\,d\vc x, $$
$$ f(t) := \sum_{d=1}^3\int_{\partial\Omega^d}\vc q(t,\vc x)\cdot\vc n(\vc x) \,d\vc x $$
is the volume \units{}{3}{}, the volume source \units{}{3}{-1} and the volume flux \units{}{3}{-1} of the liquid at time $t$, respectively.
The volume, flux and source on every geometrical region is calculated at each computational time step and the values together with the control sums are written to the file \texttt{water\_balance.txt}.
