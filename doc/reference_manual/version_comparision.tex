In this chapter we are comparing two consecutively released versions 1.6.7 and 1.7.0. 

We will use class \verb'Profiler' to get profiling information about the computation 
and next we will compare differences in measured time consumed during running different 
pieces of code. Problems will be solved with both versions and different number 
of processors will be used in parallel computation.

The benchmarks were computed in Supercomputing Centre of Czech Technical University.


\section{Problem of transport in Melechov region}

This benchmark is based on real data. We are solving transport of a single 
substance from the concentration source in the Melechov region which is considered as
one of the localities suitable for building nuclear waste deposit.
