In this chapter we compare the computing efficiency of released versions of Flow123d. We provide 
some of the time profiling information gathered from benchmarks, point out and discuss the differences 
among different versions. Two consecutively released versions 1.6.7 and 1.7.0 has been profiled so far.

In the section \ref{sec:compare_mel} we present a benchmark based on real data. It is a complex 
problem of flow and transport in the Melechov region. Results of profiling are shown and discussed 
in details.

In the section \ref{sec:compare_sources} we show problems that occured during upgrading input files from
version 1.6.7 to 1.7.0. It was not possible to prescribe transport source in older versions
so one used to delete the source elements from the mesh and prescribe transport and flow Dirichlet boundary condition instead.
We solved the problem in both cases with version 1.6.7 and compared it with 1.7.0.

This benchmark is based on the real data. We solve transport of a single 
substance from the concentration source in the Melechov region which is considered as
one of the localities suitable for building a nuclear waste deposit.
We used cluster 'hal' in the Supercomputing Centre of Czech Technical University for the computation.
The general information on the benchmark is summarized:

\begin{verbatim}

mesh size:         56355 elements
compared versions: 1.6.7 (rev.2392) flow123d/branches/1.6.7 
                   1.7.0 (rev.2416) flow123d/trunk 
data available on

\end{verbatim}

We use the class \verb'Profiler' to get time profiling information -- measured times that are taken by running different 
pieces of code. Selected problems are solved with different versions and different number 
of processors is used in parallel computation also to see scaling efficiency.


The results of profiling can be seen in the table \ref{tab:profiler_Mel1}. One can see in the header 
of the table that the problem was computed several times on different number of proccessors, with both 
versions 1.6.7 and 1.7.0. Number of calls of different routines and maximum amount of time which is 
spent on one of the proccessors during the routine (column \emph{Tmax}) have been measured.
We will now discuss some of the results which are highlighted in \ref{tab:profiler_Mel1}.


\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Assembly.} The amount of time needed for \emph{assembly} of the mixed hybrid system (in \emph{Darcy constructor}) 
was mainly increased by moving some of the precomputations from mesh reading routines directly into the assembly proccess. 
This is the part which we can optimize in the future and futhermore we would like to make it faster by implementing numerical 
integration using new system of classes for handling degrees of freedom, finite element values etc.

\item \textbf{Mesh reading.} Another thing that is slowing down the computation is reading of the mesh. Version 1.7.0 seems 
to be slower because the neighboring of elements is computed directly in runtime. By contrast the older version uses still 
the utility \verb'NGH' to generate neighboring file which is used later (this procedure is not measured). We can also see along the 
row \emph{Reading mesh} that this routine is not scaling at all. Until we implement classes for handling the mesh in parallel 
way this will not be any faster.

\item \textbf{Solving MH System.} We can see the increase in time needed for solving mixed hybrid system. The computation 
of Schur complements needs to be optimized.

\item \textbf{Convection matrix assembly.}
In the \emph{convection matrix assembly} routine we can see improvement from version 1.6.7 to 1.7.0. This routine scales better in
newer version and this probably can still be further optimized.

\item \textbf{Transport Operator Splitting -- one step.}
It seems the newer version 1.7.0 is a bit faster there. The difference is mainly caused by some small 
changes in determining the time step of convection. There are fewer convection steps in version 
1.7.0 so the routine does not last so long. But still the average time of one convection step 
is shorter.

\item \textbf{Output.} There are two parts of the output -- output of the Darcy flow computation (row \emph{Darcy output}) and 
output of the transport operator splitting method (row \emph{TOS-output}). We can see that both have been slowed down 
(output of water flow almost twice) and that both of them are not scaling at all. The problem of
slowing down is currently being solved. Next step will be taken in making the code parallel as 
soon as we have parallel mesh available.

\section{Transport sources}
\label{sec:compare_sources}
The problem of transport sources can be viewed in different ways. We can prescribe a~concentration source term in a~region of a~mesh 
or we can cut off that region from the mesh and then prescribe a~Dirichlet boundary condition (both for flow and transport)
on the created boundary. The second way was used in some models when transport sources had not been implemented in Flow123d yet.
In this section we would like to show the user the comparision of both techniques used on the real problem and point out some problems
that occured (or that may occure in the future if one is not careful).

\subsection{Water Flow}
When deleting the source elements and prescribing the Dirichlet boundary condition for transport instead 
of source term, we must also define a Dirichlet boundary condition for flow on the boundary. The problem that arises is that we 
do not know the values of pressure to prescribe. 

One used to compute the flow in the whole area at first to find the values of the pressure on the elements sides 
where the concentration source is. Then one computed the problem again without the elements of the concentration source and with the 
Dirichlet boundary condition for flow applied (values of pressure computed before).

        \label{fig:bench_mel2}
\end{figure}
%
\begin{figure}[!h]

        \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{tests_graphics/mel_167s-170_velocity_equal.pdf}
        \caption{Difference in flow velocities between solutions computed by versions 1.6.7 and 1.7.0 (with sources term).
                 Red brick is the concentration source region.}
        \label{fig:bench_mel5}
\end{figure}


In the figure \ref{fig:bench_mel1} we are showing the difference between the older solution (with Dirichlet BC 
prescribed in the area of deleted elements) and the solution in the compact area. We can see that there is a~considerable 
difference in the nearby area of deleted elements. In this case the reason is that somehow wrong values 
of pressure were prescribed as the Dirichlet BC. One can look for the difference into the raw output file 
where pressure and velocity on element sides can be found. The solutions in farther regions are considered equal 
with the precision of the solver $10^{-7}$.

To prove that the velocities are the same whether the source region is present in the mesh or not, we recalculated the flow and used the correct pressure values
for the Dirichlet boundary condition. The result is shown in the figure \ref{fig:bench_mel2} where the difference is much smaller.
The source of the difference comes most probably from the postprocessing where the velocities are computed from the pressure. 
The error of pressure computed by solver (in order of $10^{-7}$) can be increased by multiplication with the conductivity
which is larger than 1000 in some regions.

%         \caption{Elementwise pressure head and velocity field (triangles).}
%         \label{fig:bench_mel2}
%     \end{subfigure}
% \end{figure}

In the figure \ref{fig:bench_mel5} we also demonstrate small difference in water flow computed by versions 1.6.7 and 1.7.0. 
There are 5 areas where the difference is larger than the solver accuracy (set $10^{-7}$). This is caused again by 
postprocessing as we mentioned above.

\subsection{Transport}
The transport of the substance was computed over time period of $10^4$ years. In the figure \ref{fig:bench_mel3} we can see 
where the substance spread in concentration above $10^{-7}$~\unitss{1}{-3}{} which again corresponds to the solver accuracy.
We can compare the solutions computed by different versions in subfigures \ref{fig:bench_mel3a} to \ref{fig:bench_mel3c}.
The transport is caused only by convection so the velocities computed before are determining. As we can see in the figure 
\ref{fig:bench_mel1}, the difference in velocities is positive which means the velocities were smaller when the wrong Dirichlet 
boundary condition for flow was prescribed on the concentration source region. That is why the convectional transport is 
also slower in that case as we can observe in the figure \ref{fig:bench_mel3a}. 
The transport computed with source term prescribed is the same in both versions 1.6.7 and 1.7.0 as ilustrated in the figure
\ref{fig:bench_mel3b} and \ref{fig:bench_mel3c}. One can open Paraview state file to see that the difference in transport is in
order $10^{-7}$ corresponding again to the solver accuracy.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Concentration of the transported substance after $10^4$ years.}
    \label{fig:bench_mel3}
\end{figure}

Because the problem was originally computed on $10^6$ years, we show in figures \ref{fig:bench_mel4a} to \ref{fig:bench_mel4c} 
also the results of transport after this longer period.

\vfil

\textbf{Conclusion.} We can conclude that the results in all cases are the same with respect to the solver accuracy (both flow and transport) when 
the input files are made correctly. We would obtain the same results of transport in all three cases like shown in figures \ref{fig:bench_mel3b}, \ref{fig:bench_mel3c} and 
\ref{fig:bench_mel4b}, \ref{fig:bench_mel4c}. Comparing the solutions, pressure and velocity are equal when correct boundary condition values are applied. 
The transport can be defined both by Dirichlet boundary condition on the source region and by prescribing a source term on that region. 
We should mention that we used the source term in the form $F_S = \sigma_s(c_S-c)$, according to (\ref{eqn:transport_sources}).

\emph{\textbf{Notice.} If user compares the solutions of transport computed in versions 1.6.7 and 1.7.0 in Paraview (or other SW)
be aware of a little bug in version 1.6.7 -- the transport steps are labeled only by numbers (1,2,3,...) not by the 
corresponding times. }

\subsection{Faced problems}
Several errors, bugs and problems on user side has arised while converting the 
input structure to version 1.7.0 and while doing profiling. The followings should be avoided in the future.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Problem} of \verb'.mtr'. file. There are several versions of input material file for 
        different Melechov meshes. Regions that are not present in the mesh and quantities that are not used in
        the equations are all ignored in version 1.6.7. This can be very confusing when transforming the input
        for the newer version 1.7.0. Fortunately newer version provides feedback on this matter and writes
        warnings in log file.

  \item \textbf{Problem.} We described how concentration source can be prescribed by transport boundary condition above.
        To remove the elements from the mesh one used to only delete the neighborings in \verb'.ngh' file and then
        set the boundary condition on elements inside the bulk. This is not possible in newer versions and when using
        old \verb'.fbc' file with this kind of boundary condition, these  will be ignored.
  
  \item \textbf{Problem} with sigma parameter describing communication between fractures and volume.
        In version 1.6.7 this parameter is well hidden in \verb'.ngh' file as a tag at the end of
        lines. In version 1.7.0 one has to set this parameter in the bulk record of 2d and 1d regions 
        else the default value 1.0 will be used instead. A better physical model for estimation of this 
        parameter is beiing developed.

  \item \textbf{Problem} with solver accuracy. We found user mistakes in defining the solver accuracy in 
        old \verb'.ini' file. In version 1.6.7 one can use section \verb'Solver' to set solver accuracy,
        relative and absolute tolerance of the solver. Other way to set solver accuracy is to put it as
        input argument for Flow123d: \\
        \verb'          -ksp_atol 1.0e-10 -ksp_rtol 1.0e-10 -ksp_monitor'. \\
        These values are then passed to the PETSC solver.
        
  
%  \item \textbf{Problem} with (NOT) prescribing Dirichlet boudnary condition on the fractures. 

\end{itemize}
