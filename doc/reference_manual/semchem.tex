\subsection{General Chemical Reactions}
For a simulation of general chemical reactions as a part of reactive transport simulation, an application Semchem has been merged together with Flow123D. It enables to simulate following types of reactions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chemical equilibrium (solved using iterative Newtons method)
    \subitem mathematical description $K^{(r)} = \prod_i c_i^{\alpha_i^{(r)}},$

  \item Slow evolving chemical kinetics (solved using Runge-Kutta method)
    \subitem mathematical description $\frac{dc_i}{dt} = -k^{(r)}\prod_j c_j^{\beta_j^{(r)}},$

  \item Fast evolving chemical kinetics (discretized using implicit Eulerova method and solved using Newtons method)
     \subitem mathematical description $\frac{c_i^{(T+1)} - c_i^{T}}{\Delta t} = -k^{(r)}\prod_j c_j^{\beta_j^{(r),(T+1)}},$
  \item Radioactive decay can be simulated as a special case of first order reaction.
\end{itemize}
