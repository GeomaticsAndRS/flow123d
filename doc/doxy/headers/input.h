/**
 * @defgroup input  Input Classes
 *
 *  This module collects the classes of the unified input interface for reading of
 *  JSON-like input files and possibly other files with similar structure.
 *
 *  The classes in the namespace Input::Type allows declaration of basic and compound input type objects.
 *  These objects specifies the structure of the input which, on the one hand, is used by reader classes in Input::Storage namespace
 *  to check correctness of the input and by the classes in the namespace Input::Interface for access to the read data, on the other hand
 *  the structure of the input can be printed out together with documentation. This provides basic documentation of the input files that
 *  is conforming with the input used in the program.
