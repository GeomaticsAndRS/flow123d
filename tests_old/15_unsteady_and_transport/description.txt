Test problem 15
---------------------
verification of:
- unsteady flow (LMH) + transport
- implicit transport with dispersion

setting:

rectangle (0,1)x(0,16)
flow: 
  zero dirichlet BC for x=0, zero Neuman else, source = -x
  conductivity 1.0
  storativity 1.0
  initial piezo head =0
  (i.e. initial pressure = 0)
  
  solution:
    pressure = -tx
    velocity = t

transport: 
  dirichlet BC = 10.0 on the inflow (on left) for time interval (0,0.1)

  solution for t>0.1: conc = 10.0 on (0,0.005) + t^2/2 and zero elsewhere
