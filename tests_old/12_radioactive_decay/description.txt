Test problem 12
---------------
Both following tests are realized without combination with transport (zero pressure gradient).
verification of:
- first order reaction A->B determined by kinetic constant,
-- 6 chemical species (A, B, .., F) are transported but just 2 of them take a part in considered first order kinetic reaction wich looks as follows
--- D->F, appropriate kinetic constant is k = 0.277258872.
--- Initail conditions look as follows, A(0) = 0.01, B(0) = 0.02, C(0) = 0.03, D(0) = 0.04, E(0) = 0.05, F(0) = 0.06.
--- Transport boundary conditions does not matter because zero presure gradient is considered.
--- Final concentrations of all isotopes except A, B, C, E do not change. Concentrations of D decreases to 0.003. Concentration of F increase to 0.85 in 20 time steps.

- narrow radioctive decay chain without branches, A -> B -> C,
-- 6 isotopes (A, B, .., F) are transported but just 3 of them are members of considered decay chain which looks as folows
--- D->F->B
--- Initail conditions look as follows, A(0) = 0.01, B(0) = 0.02, C(0) = 0.03, D(0) = 0.04, E(0) = 0.05, F(0) = 0.06.
--- Transport boundary conditions does not matter because zero presure gradient is considered.
--- Final concentrations of all isotopes except A, C, E do not change. Concentrations of D and B decrease to 0.004 and 0.012 respectively. Concentration of B increase to 0.1 in 20 time steps.
