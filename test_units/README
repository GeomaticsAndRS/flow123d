This directory is meant for unit tests based on CppUnit or similar tools.

In order to test also correct ASSERTs there should be possibility catch the error messages e.g.
ther could be compiler flag that makes xprinf throw exception containing the text of the message.
Then in the test we just check that exceptin was thrown. We can not check that the right exception was thrown unless we compare the text of the message, but that could be dengerous
since texts are offten changed.
