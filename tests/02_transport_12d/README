Test problem 2
---------------------

verification of:
-flow
-explicit transport (convection, dual porosity, sorption)
-implicit transport (convection, dispersion)
-multidimensional connection (1D-2D)

preparing input:
- run the script
  - ngh (finding neighbours in mesh)
  - bcd (defining boundary conditions)
