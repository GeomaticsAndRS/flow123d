Test problem 2
---------------------

verification of:
-flow
-explicit transport (convection, dual porosity, sorption)
-implicit transport (convection, dispersion)
-multidimensional connection (1D-2D)

preparing input:
Current reference data are computed on mesh input/test2.msh, we have no GEO file for it.
GEO file compatible.geo was created as qualitative eqivalent of the mesh, but the mesh file and reference data
has to be recreated, yet.
