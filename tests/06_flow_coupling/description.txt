Test problem 6
---------------------
verification of:
- correct communication between dimensions

flow_23.con:
  cube coupled with square fracture on the bottom
  Dirichlet prescribed on the rest of the boundary
  
  p3(x,y,z) = xyz     f3=0 
  
  sigma * (  p3(x,y,-1) - p2(x,y) ) == -n .dot. k3*grad p3 = k3 xy                 // 3d outflow
  
  p2(x,y) = -xy - k3/sigma *xy = - (k3/sigma + 1) * xy;  f2(x,y) = 0   

flow_12.con:
    2d strip + 1d fracture + 2x 2d strip  - branch like in test 13, but with 1d fracture
