Test problem 6
---------------------
verification of:
- correct communication between dimensions 3d-2d and 2d-1d

flow_32d.con:
  Cube coupled with square fracture on the bottom.
  Dirichlet BC p3(x,y,z) prescribed on the rest of the boundary.                             p3(x,y,z) := z
  No sources f3 are present in the cube.                                                     f3 := 0
  Homogenous Neumann prescribed on the boundary of the fraction (zero outflow and inflow).   q2 .dot. n := 0
  To obtain Laplace equation with zero rhs on the 2d fraction, 
  we prescribe a new source term that eliminates the inflow coming from the cube.         
  
    q32 = q3 .dot. n = -n .dot. k3 * grad(p3)
    
    F2 = delta2 * f2 + q32 := 0
    f2 = -q32/delta2
    
  which is for             delta2 := 10        k3 := 2     n = (0,0,-1)
  
    f2 = -0.2.
  
  From the flow coupling equation (flow 3d-2d == 3d outflow)
 
     sigma32 * ( p3(x,y,-1) - p2(x,y) ) == q32   
   
  we know the pressure on the plane which we can verify. For  
  
    sigma32 := 1      
  
  the pressure is p2 = -3.
  
  
  

flow_21d.con:
    Plane in xy coupled with channel fracture in x=0.
    Dirichlet BC p2(x,y) prescribed on the rest of the boundary.                               p2(x,y) := x
    No sources f2 are present in the plane.                                                    f2 := 0
    Homogenous Neumann prescribed on the boundary of the fraction (zero outflow and inflow).   q1 .dot. n := 0
    To obtain Laplace equation with zero rhs on the 1d fraction, 
    we prescribe a new source term that eliminates the inflow coming from the cube.         
  
    q21 = q2 .dot. n = -n .dot. (delta2 * k2 * grad(p2))
    
    F1 = delta1 * f1 + q21 := 0
    f1 = -q21/delta1
    
  which is for             delta2 := 10     delta1 := 20        k2 := 5     n = (-1,0,0)
  
    f1 = -delta2/delta1 * K2 = -2.5.
  
  From the flow coupling equation (flow 2d-1d == 2d outflow)
 
     sigma21 * ( p3(0,y) - p2(y) ) == q21
   
  we know the pressure on the plane which we can verify. For  
  
    sigma21 := 2      
  
  the pressure is p1 = -2.5.
