Test19_BC_interpolation
-------------------------
- verification of interpolation of boundary condition for piezo_head


The input file "large_cube_solution.msh" for interpolation was computed from "flow_large_gmsh.con".

To view comparision of the large mesh and small mesh with interpolated bc
compute "flow_large_vtk.con" and then add results when opening Paraview with state file "compare_interpolation.pvsm"

meshes generated by commands:

LARGE="large_mesh.geo"
SMALL="small_mesh.geo"
gmsh -2 -algo front2d -3 -algo front3d $LARGE
gmsh -2 -algo front2d -3 -algo front3d $SMALL
