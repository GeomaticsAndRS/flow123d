TEST05 - Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin boundary condition for Darcy flow

- three tests on different types of flow bc
- the same geometry, mesh and analytic solution
- boundary conditions are derived from exact solution

geometry:
- square in xy coordinates with corner points [0,0] and [1,1]
- each side has its own boundary - south,east,north,west

exact solution:
- u = xy

Dirichlet test - flow_dirichlet.con:
- all sides have dirichlet bc 
- south: 0; east: y; north: x; west: 0            (pressure)

Neumann test - flow_neumann.con:
- two sides have dirichlet bc: east: y; west: 0   (pressure)
- two sides have neumann bc: south: x; north -x   (flux)

Robin test - flow_robin.con: 
- two sides have dirichlet bc: east: y; west: 0   (pressure)

- after replacement boundary pressure is u_r=(1+sigma)/sigma*x
- two sides have robin bc: south: -2x; north 3x   (pressure)
- sigma is chosen to be 0.5

results:
- difference from the exact solution can be shown in paraview (saved state)
