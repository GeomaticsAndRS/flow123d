/** @brief Class implements algorithm for dim-dimensional intersections with 3D elements.
 * 
 * @p dim-D elements that are continuously neighbouring are called component elements.
 * 3D elements are called bulk elements.
 * 
 * Implements the initialization routine, that finds the first candidate for intersection.
 * It uses bounding boxes to fastly resolve intersection candidates. 
 * We call elements whose bounding boxes are intersecting 'candidates'.
 * 
 * Finding first candidate:
 *      - BIH search algorithm - build BIH and use it to find first candidates of components
 *      - BB search algorithm - compute only bounding boxes and search through till finding candidates
 * 
 * Implements prolongation algorithm that recursively searches neighbouring elements for next intersection candidates.
 * The candidates -- neighbouring component elements and bulk elements -- are pushed into separate queues.
 * The bulk elements queue is emptied at first, then the component elements queue is popped.
 * 
 * The recuring prolongation algorithm is as follows:
 * Function @p prolongation_decide fills the queues.
 * A candidate pair of elements is popped out of a queue.
 * Function @p prolongate computes intersection for a candidate pair and calls @p prolongation_decide again.
 * This is done in an infinite cycle, until both queues are empty.
 * 
 * Three algorithms are implemented:
 * 
 *      - BIH only: creates BIH, uses BIH to search through all elements to find candidates
 *      - BIH search: creates BIH, uses BIH to find only first candidates of components; then uses prolongation
 *      - BB search: does not create BIH, uses bounding boxes to search through all elements to find candidates
 * 
 * Due to optimal tracing algorithm for 2d-3d, we consider tetrahedron only with positive Jacobian.
 * This is checked in assert.
 * 
 * TODO: check unit test prolongation 13d, because it has different results for BIH only and BB search

/** @brief Implements algorithm for finding 1D-2D intersections.
 * 
 * There are 3 possibilities of computation:
 * 
 * 1) 2D problem with 1D fractures
 *  2D mesh is a plane and 1D mesh is the same plane; then we can solve the intersection only in 2D,
 *  probably not using Plucker; we can apply some prolongation algorithm like in 1D-3D..
 * 
 * 2) 1D-2D intersection on 3D space
 *  1D and 2D meshes are arbitrarily placed in 3D space; then we need to compute intersections using Plucker
 *  coordinates and we cannot rely on prolongation algorithm (only if there are 2 IPs
 *  -> both lie in the same plane)
 *  - assuming that a 2D mesh component is mostly a plane in our applications (not an arbitrarily curved surface)
 * 
 * 3) 1D-2D intersection inside 3D mesh
 *  1D and 2D mesh is inside a bulk mesh (3D); if 2D-3D and 1D-3D has been computed,
 *  we can iterate over 3D intersection and get candidates if there is both 1D-3D and 2D-3D
 *  at the same time.
 *  We might need to deal with intersections outside 3D mesh, using partially algorithm (2)
